Credit and Profile Data which is Strcutured as a csv file has been used
I have tried to see the accuracy of Score predictions using various standalone models.
Models such as RandomForests(RF), Logistic Regression Model (GLM), Recursive partitioning(Rpart).
Also created three Customised ensembles by using three techniques like averaging, median and mean to understand.
Also deployed a superlearner to compare our other models performance.

Results:
Among individual models Recursive Partitioning gave best results. 
Among Ensembles, None of them were close to Superlearner model results of 0.739 accuracy.
